# Unexpected Behavior with Tailwind's `@apply` Directive

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive.  The issue arises when attempting to apply a utility class using `@apply` and later overriding styles within the same CSS selector.  In certain situations, the `@apply` styles may be unexpectedly overridden or ignored.  This inconsistency can lead to unpredictable styling and debugging challenges.

## Reproducing the Bug

The `bug.css` file contains the minimal code necessary to reproduce the issue.  Observe that even though `text-red-500` is applied, the `background-color` is the only style showing up.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file showcases two possible solutions for solving this problem:   Using different selectors to avoid conflicts and or use `!important` flag (use sparingly)
